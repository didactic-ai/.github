## Hi there 👋

Welcome to Didactic.AI, a non-profit initiative firmly rooted in the ethos of transformative education. We recognize the critical issue in today's online educational environment: social media recommendation algorithms, which prioritize maximizing ad revenue through increased retention. Our mission? To provide a distinct, more enriching alternative.

## Our approach
Like a compass in the vast expanse of online educational content, we aim to connect students with the most relevant materials at the right time. Didactic.AI harnesses the power of AI in a two-pronged approach to personalize the educational journey for every student.
### 🧑‍🎓 Understanding Students
Firstly, we use AI to dive into student data, capturing their unique learning preferences, needs, and interests. This deep analysis allows us to tailor each learner's journey to their distinct requirements.
### 📚 Evaluating Educational Content
Secondly, our AI tools evaluate the vast sea of online educational content. We discern teaching styles, educational value, and subject areas, enabling us to navigate through the wealth of resources and identify the perfect matches for each student.
